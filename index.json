Having a career could mean that the person is changing jobs over and over again, or they might want to be like a company or employer and work in a certain role for years or maybe even a career. An example of this is a sales executive. People become leaders in companies, if they work hard they can become a director in a company. If people are given some set of requirements to work on, their careers can be designed to suit that. There are people that may be asked to work in a certain job for many years and that could lead to them becoming a director in the company. However if the company was going to go under, the person could become unemployed. This example shows that career means different things to different people. What it means to have a job? What does it mean to have a job? Job is not a fixed position. In most cases a person has multiple jobs that he/she can choose from. There are many means to acquire jobs. Examples of these are self-employment, career, company jobs and employment by design. So, what is a career? It is a way of working towards something; a goal that a person has in mind to accomplish. In a work context a person has a job so that his work can progress towards a particular aim. Job vs job relation While a job gives you wages and other benefits, a career provides direction and meaning to life. This meaning comes from your connection to your work and what you contribute to it. How do we choose a career? Research what career you want. Learn and experience about careers and their role in our society. Difference between a career and a job A career is anything that you will be doing for a number of years. You are either in a career or you are not. A job is a job that you do for a limited amount of time. You do your work during that time and then leave that job. Then comes another job. Career vs job: What’s in it for you? The kind of career that you choose will depend on your interests and your skills. If you are good with computers and want to earn a living from programming, you can become a software developer. There are so many options out there for you. Check out this job selector where you can look for jobs based on the skills you already have. Why you should have a career You get to learn new things and challenges; you will be exposed to new environments. It is a good time to work, because you do get to have choices in terms of career. Conclusion Once you have decided to start working for yourself, you should start planning for it. The internet makes it easy to do research and read stories about others who are doing it too. You can get some insights from people from forums and blogs. Even though no one will give you any detailed advice, it helps to get a feel of the challenges and then you can take the necessary action to deal with them.

If you had asked me a few years ago what AI was, I would have answered that it’s software that tells computers to do certain things. In the past, AI has been mostly done with the objective of computer systems performing specific tasks faster and better than humans. The first automated financial trading system was developed around 1990 and later real time trading on the stock market came into being in 1997. AI is becoming very advance and taking over work in every aspect of work. It might also take over the world, if not controlled. The idea of AI has its basis in the field of linguistics and machine learning. The idea is to give computers the ability to learn on their own by analysing, understanding and repeating actions. The Future of AI AI is coming from movies and sci-fi movies and shows, but it might not be so far ahead. The future is becoming a lot more real and now. AI is in every sense developing at a rapid pace. However, one of the biggest concerns and questions is when and how? So the big question that needs to be answered is how are we humans going to manage to manage and control artificial intelligence. We can’t let AI take over the world. As far as human development is concerned, we can’t afford to, because it is our future that is at stake. The University of Waterloo is taking measures to make sure that the problem is not taken by AI or a machine. They have a team that is researching how artificial intelligence and machine learning are affecting people’s lives and have a positive impact. How technology will change our lives Robot is about to become your assistant: Wake up to your coffee with Alexa, make it to work with a Mercedes, or maybe even be your lover? Robots will be taking over the jobs of the most common people in the world: People working in the field of service and office job. AI will be built in to the smartphones: Same with any device that we have at home, now the smartphone is just another artificial intelligence. The future of smartphones will be the owner’s assistant: which can learn from experience. The next step will be that the smartphone will be able to learn even more and then act in the situations it’s familiar with, even before it happens. Humanity and machine learning According to the eVolo World Architecture Competition, we are about to see a new type of building. A building made of self-tuning structures, AI. The AI designs building elements on the size, shape and mass needed to meet needs, all on its own. According to the competition organizers, this construction means buildings no longer need construction workers or architects. But human operators have more responsibility in the design and construction process of the building. The goal is to provide lower construction and construction labor costs. The eVolo Institute for Design Innovation 2018 Global Architecture Competition It’s not that technology is taking over, it’s how we utilize the new technology. And that’s what is important to explore. Conclusion AI will take over the world soon. There is no way to stop it now, but to stay up to date and remain aware of the truth about AI. AI is developing fast and there are a lot of myths and truths to stay up to date about. Google’s Eric Schmidt speaking in Paris a couple of weeks ago said, “There is no doubt that AI will be more effective than any human.” ","date":"0001-01-01","objectID":"/blogs/what-ai-means-for-us/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"What AI Means for Us: The Future of Technology and Humanity","uri":"/blogs/what-ai-means-for-us/"},{"categories":null,"content":" What are Electric Cars? They are a car that does not use petrol as a fuel and instead relies on electricity. This can be generated from a variety of different sources, such as solar panels, wind farms or other sources of energy that we produce on site. Electric cars offer the advantage of the same level of efficiency and fuel efficiency as petrol or diesel cars. The only difference is the fact that there is no petrol or diesel involved. This means that electric cars take up much less space and weight on the roads than conventional fuel cars, as well as giving off much less pollution. Electric cars tend to be very low in maintenance and can last for years without a break. Tesla, and other companies, are already producing electric cars and they are still in the early stages of development. Why the Future of Electric Cars Looks Bright If we speak about cities then there is no doubt that electric cars would have a major impact on their functioning. Public transport In the public transport scenario, the adoption of electric cars would bring in significant changes. For instance, in LA Metro, all the buses are now being powered by electric. It can be also applied to other public transportation vehicles. By Air When it comes to air travel, electric cars are leading the way. The use of electric cars reduces the carbon footprint by a big margin. Besides, in terms of its performance, electric cars are far more fuel-efficient than the conventional cars. They can fly for 500 kilometres on a single charge. Sustainable Air The use of electric cars helps the environment in a very big way. Negative Impacts on Electric Cars Electric cars can make sense if they replace high polluting diesel and petrol cars. But, if they replace cars with low emissions, that’s a big no-no. Only electric cars should be allowed in cities. Energy Saving and Energy Upgrades are not Cheap There is an alternative solution to this problem. We can move the power source from the grid to home and business. But that would cost a lot of money and lots of work. It is an expensive solution but the worst thing is that it is really difficult to implement at the same time that power grids are being improved. Also Read: Businesses Turning to Electric Cars But, Electric Cars are in Trouble The other day I visited my new school and I saw my 8-year-old daughter’s eyes light up when I told her that I am going to take a hybrid car to school. Positive Impacts on Electric Cars The positives of electric cars include: Environment As of now, the electric cars are clean. Even though they are high on emissions, they are a small contribution to global pollution and climate change. You won’t have to worry about the environment for a while, and that is always a good thing. If electric cars become more popular and profitable, more people will be encouraged to purchase them and adopt sustainable energy systems. Costs This is something that all people around the world love talking about. The cost of the electric car is still much higher than that of the fuel cars. This is the main reason why we haven’t seen more electric cars in the market. With more electric cars, however, the cost will go down and more people will start to buy them. Conclusion Despite the huge investment in R\u0026D to develop the new battery in Tesla, it shows that other major car makers such as Volkswagen will do the same. There is no doubt that the new battery will power more electric cars and will contribute to the mass production of electric cars.
