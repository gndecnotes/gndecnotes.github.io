<h3 id="what-are-electric-cars">What are Electric Cars?</h3>
<p>They are a car that does not use petrol as a fuel and instead relies on electricity. This can be generated from a variety of different sources, such as solar panels, wind farms or other sources of energy that we produce on site. Electric cars offer the advantage of the same level of efficiency and fuel efficiency as petrol or diesel cars. The only difference is the fact that there is no petrol or diesel involved. This means that electric cars take up much less space and weight on the roads than conventional fuel cars, as well as giving off much less pollution. Electric cars tend to be very low in maintenance and can last for years without a break. Tesla, and other companies, are already producing electric cars and they are still in the early stages of development.</p>
<h3 id="why-the-future-of-electric-cars-looks-bright">Why the Future of Electric Cars Looks Bright</h3>
<p>If we speak about cities then there is no doubt that electric cars would have a major impact on their functioning. Public transport In the public transport scenario, the adoption of electric cars would bring in significant changes. For instance, in LA Metro, all the buses are now being powered by electric. It can be also applied to other public transportation vehicles. By Air When it comes to air travel, electric cars are leading the way. The use of electric cars reduces the carbon footprint by a big margin. Besides, in terms of its performance, electric cars are far more fuel-efficient than the conventional cars. They can fly for 500 kilometres on a single charge. Sustainable Air The use of electric cars helps the environment in a very big way.</p>
<h3 id="negative-impacts-on-electric-cars">Negative Impacts on Electric Cars</h3>
<p>Electric cars can make sense if they replace high polluting diesel and petrol cars. But, if they replace cars with low emissions, that&rsquo;s a big no-no. Only electric cars should be allowed in cities. Energy Saving and Energy Upgrades are not Cheap There is an alternative solution to this problem. We can move the power source from the grid to home and business. But that would cost a lot of money and lots of work. It is an expensive solution but the worst thing is that it is really difficult to implement at the same time that power grids are being improved. Also Read: Businesses Turning to Electric Cars But, Electric Cars are in Trouble The other day I visited my new school and I saw my 8-year-old daughter&rsquo;s eyes light up when I told her that I am going to take a hybrid car to school.</p>
<h3 id="positive-impacts-on-electric-cars">Positive Impacts on Electric Cars</h3>
<p>The positives of electric cars include: Environment As of now, the electric cars are clean. Even though they are high on emissions, they are a small contribution to global pollution and climate change. You won&rsquo;t have to worry about the environment for a while, and that is always a good thing. If electric cars become more popular and profitable, more people will be encouraged to purchase them and adopt sustainable energy systems. Costs This is something that all people around the world love talking about. The cost of the electric car is still much higher than that of the fuel cars. This is the main reason why we haven&rsquo;t seen more electric cars in the market. With more electric cars, however, the cost will go down and more people will start to buy them.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Despite the huge investment in R&amp;D to develop the new battery in Tesla, it shows that other major car makers such as Volkswagen will do the same. There is no doubt that the new battery will power more electric cars and will contribute to the mass production of electric cars.
