<h3 id="what-is-ai">What is AI?</h3>
<p>If you had asked me a few years ago what AI was, I would have answered that it&rsquo;s software that tells computers to do certain things. In the past, AI has been mostly done with the objective of computer systems performing specific tasks faster and better than humans. The first automated financial trading system was developed around 1990 and later real time trading on the stock market came into being in 1997. AI is becoming very advance and taking over work in every aspect of work. It might also take over the world, if not controlled. The idea of AI has its basis in the field of linguistics and machine learning. The idea is to give computers the ability to learn on their own by analysing, understanding and repeating actions.</p>
<h3 id="the-future-of-ai">The Future of AI</h3>
<p>AI is coming from movies and sci-fi movies and shows, but it might not be so far ahead. The future is becoming a lot more real and now. AI is in every sense developing at a rapid pace. However, one of the biggest concerns and questions is when and how? So the big question that needs to be answered is how are we humans going to manage to manage and control artificial intelligence. We can’t let AI take over the world. As far as human development is concerned, we can’t afford to, because it is our future that is at stake. The University of Waterloo is taking measures to make sure that the problem is not taken by AI or a machine. They have a team that is researching how artificial intelligence and machine learning are affecting people’s lives and have a positive impact.</p>
<h3 id="how-technology-will-change-our-lives">How technology will change our lives</h3>
<p>Robot is about to become your assistant: Wake up to your coffee with Alexa, make it to work with a Mercedes, or maybe even be your lover? Robots will be taking over the jobs of the most common people in the world: People working in the field of service and office job. AI will be built in to the smartphones: Same with any device that we have at home, now the smartphone is just another artificial intelligence. The future of smartphones will be the owner’s assistant: which can learn from experience. The next step will be that the smartphone will be able to learn even more and then act in the situations it’s familiar with, even before it happens.</p>
<h3 id="humanity-and-machine-learning">Humanity and machine learning</h3>
<p>According to the eVolo World Architecture Competition, we are about to see a new type of building. A building made of self-tuning structures, AI. The AI designs building elements on the size, shape and mass needed to meet needs, all on its own. According to the competition organizers, this construction means buildings no longer need construction workers or architects. But human operators have more responsibility in the design and construction process of the building. The goal is to provide lower construction and construction labor costs. The eVolo Institute for Design Innovation 2018 Global Architecture Competition It&rsquo;s not that technology is taking over, it&rsquo;s how we utilize the new technology. And that&rsquo;s what is important to explore.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>AI will take over the world soon. There is no way to stop it now, but to stay up to date and remain aware of the truth about AI. AI is developing fast and there are a lot of myths and truths to stay up to date about. Google’s Eric Schmidt speaking in Paris a couple of weeks ago said, “There is no doubt that AI will be more effective than any human.” Check out the full video of Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google.</p>
